# Sync Bookmarks

Check bookmarks for dead links, remove duplicates, organize by topic.

## 1. Export Bookmarks

Using your **browser skill** or file system, get bookmarks from the default browser:
- Chrome, Safari, Firefox, or other installed browser
- All bookmarks including folders

## 2. Check for Dead Links

Test each bookmark URL:
- **200** — Alive, working
- **301/302** — Redirect (update the URL)
- **404** — Dead (flag for removal)
- **Timeout** — May be temporarily down (flag for review)

Rate limit checks to avoid being blocked (1 request per second).

## 3. Find Duplicates

Check for:
- Identical URLs
- URLs that differ only by trailing slash
- Same URL with different protocols (http vs https)
- Same domain + path with different query parameters

## 4. Organize by Topic

Suggest folder organization based on bookmark content:
- **Dev/Programming** — GitHub, Stack Overflow, documentation
- **News/Reading** — News sites, blogs, articles
- **Tools/Apps** — Web apps, SaaS tools
- **Reference** — Wikipedia, docs, tutorials
- **Shopping** — Retail sites
- **Social** — Social media links
- **Misc** — Everything else

## 5. Present Findings
