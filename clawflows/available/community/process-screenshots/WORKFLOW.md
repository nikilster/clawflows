# Process Screenshots

Sort screenshots into dated folders, remove duplicates, clean up old ones.

## 1. Find Screenshots

Using your **file system skill**, scan for screenshot files:
- Desktop
- Downloads
- Default screenshot location

Look for common screenshot patterns:
- "Screenshot" or "Screen Shot" in filename
- "CleanShot" or other screenshot tool names
- PNG files with timestamp patterns

## 2. Organize by Date

For each screenshot:
1. Extract the date from the filename or file metadata
2. Create the target folder: `~/Pictures/Screenshots/YYYY-MM/`
3. Move the file to the appropriate folder

Preserve original filenames.

## 3. Remove Duplicates

Check for duplicate files:
- Files with identical sizes and similar timestamps
- Files with `(1)`, `(2)` suffixes
- Near-identical screenshots (if image comparison available)

Remove duplicates, keeping the oldest (original).

## 4. Clean Up Old Screenshots

Find screenshots older than 90 days:
- List them for review
- Offer to delete or archive

Most screenshots are temporary — old ones are rarely needed.

## 5. Present Results
