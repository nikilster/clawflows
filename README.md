  <img src="docs/header.png" alt="ClawFlows" width="100%" />
</p>

ClawFlows is a workflow system for OpenClaw with 100+ prebuilt community workflows you can enable in 1 click.

Some examples:
- 📧 **Process my email** — Junk unsubscribed, noise archived, important stuff summarized. Your inbox, handled.
- ☀️ **Morning briefing** — Weather, calendar, priorities, and fires — delivered before you open your eyes.
- 🛏️ **Sleep mode** — Every light off, music stopped, thermostat down, bedroom fan on. One command. Five systems. Done.
- 🎯 **Prep for my meeting** — Attendees researched, history pulled, talking points written. Ready before you are.
- 🔨 **Build something while I sleep** — Picks an idea, builds it overnight, hands you a finished project in the morning.

## 🚀 Get Started In 10 Seconds

### Option 1: Direct install (recommended)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davehappyminion/clawflows/main/system/install.sh \
  | bash
```

Then enable workflows with `clawflows enable <name>`.

### Option 2: Let your agent do it

Send this message to your OpenClaw agent:

```
Install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davehappyminion/clawflows/main/system/AGENT.md
```

Your agent will install everything and ask which workflows you want to enable. Note: risk here that agent doesn't install everything fully - for 100% accuracy do Option 1.

## How to Use

Once installed, just talk to your agent naturally:

```
"Run my morning briefing"
"Check my calendar for conflicts"
"Turn on sleep mode"
"Process my email"
```

Or use the CLI to manage workflows directly:

```bash
# See what's available
clawflows list

# Enable a workflow
clawflows enable send-morning-briefing

# Disable one you don't need
clawflows disable check-x

# Get the latest workflows
clawflows update
```

When you enable a workflow, your agent automatically knows about it — no restart needed.

<br>

## Scheduling

Workflows run on autopilot from the schedule in the WORKFLOW.md file — no manual trigger needed!

```yaml
schedule: "8am, 6pm"
```

You can use plain English: `"7am"`, `"every 2 hours"`, `"morning"`, etc.

<br>

## Creating Your Own

Build your custom workflow:

```bash
clawflows create
```

This walks you through creating a new workflow. See [Creating Workflows](docs/creating-workflows.md) for the full guide.

## Share With the Community

Have a workflow others would love? Submit it!

```bash
# 1. Create and test your workflow
clawflows create
clawflows run your-workflow-name

# 2. Submit it for review
clawflows submit your-workflow-name

# 3. Open a pull request (instructions shown after submit)
```
